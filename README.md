    <strong>Doylestown Detectives</strong> is a scavenger hunt style mystery game inspired by the "Duck Tales" game in the World Showcase at Disney World Epcot. Players follow the story starring local Doylestown kids (in cartoon form) exploring the building and answering real world clues. You must be physically present in the library to be able to answer the questions and progress to see the whole story!
